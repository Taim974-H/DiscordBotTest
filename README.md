For quick launch, just add your Discord Bot token in the .env file and make sure the bot is there in your server already.

The bot does not use any database schemas, I'd suggest you to go ahead and look through youtube tutorials on how to connect your bot to a database.

I made this bot last summer without any prior knowledge in web apps or JS. Provided, I did have understanding of Java and Object Oriented Programming therefore it was
not hard for me to catch up with most of the tutorials found online and once I got the hang of it, and created a nice setup, it was all about searching for libraries
to make the bot do cool stuff. You guys should experiemnt in your own ways and have fun!
